# etch-sketch
This is an etch sketch game from The Odin Project. 

Step 1: write html to include a title for the page, a container for all elements of the page, a div for the board itself, a container of buttons such as change cololr to blue, change color back to black, eraser, and a button to reset the board. Finally I will create an input section for the user to be able to input a number from 2-100 to determine the size of the board along with a button to "submit".

Step 2: Style css to set display to grid for the board div as well as set a specific width and height for the board

step 3: Write a function to populate board with a grid of divs. inital value of 16

step 4: Add to the populate board function so that when it gets run again, the board resets automatically 

step 5: Write funtion to change color on hover to black

step 6: Write onclick events for color change buttons and reset button

step 7: Use onclick events for color change to write a color change function

step 8: Write function to change the size of the board when user changes input area
